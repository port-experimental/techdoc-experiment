The `create_missing_related_entities` parameter is used to enable the creation of missing related Port entities. This is useful when you want to create an entity and its related entity in one call, or if you want to create an entity that its related entity does not exist yet.

In both of these scenarios, the resulting _related_ entity will be a barebones entity which you can later on update with relevant information as usual.
